    "## Index Compression\n",
    "- Less disk space, usually can cut cost of storing the index by 75%\n",
    "- Increased use of caching to avoid having to use disk seeks\n",
    "- Compression techniques discussed are `lossless`, i.e. all information is preserved\n",
    "- `Lossy compression`: some information is lost (e.g. through case folding, stemming, or stop word elimination)\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Heap's Law\n",
    "- Eastimats vocabulary size as a function of collection size\n",
    "- `M = kT^b`, *T* is the number of tokens in the collection and *k* and *b* are constants\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dictionary Compression\n",
    "- Motivation: compressing the dictionary so it can fit in main memory, or at least a large portion in order to support high query throughput. \n",
    "- Also can lead to fast startup times in limited hardware systems\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1) *Dictionary-as-a-string*\n",
    "- Store the lexicographically ordered list of all terms in an array of fixed-width entries.\n",
    "- Need to store term pointers to demarcate the end of one term and the beginning of another term\n",
    "- Saves around ~40-50% in dictionary size\n",
    "\n",
    "2) *Blocked storage*\n",
    "- Grouping terms in the stirng into blocks of size `k`, keep a term pointer only for the first term of each block\n",
    "- Need to store the length of the term as an additional byte\n",
    "- Thus eliminate `k-1` term pointers but need an additional `k` bytes for storing the length of each term.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) *Front coding*\n",
    "- Consecutive entries in an alphabetically sorted list share common prefixes. \n",
    "- Common prefix is identified for a subsequence of the term list and then referred to with a special character\n",
    "\n",
    "### Postings Compression\n",
    "- Premise of `gap encoding`: gaps between postings are short, requiring a lot less space than 20 bits to store, in fact gaps for the most frequent terms such as `the` and `for` are mostly equal to 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "1) *Variable byte codes*\n",
    "- Uses an integral number of bytes to encode a gap. \n",
    "- Last 7 bits of a byte are the *payload* and encode part of the gap. The first byte is a *continuation bit*. It is set to 1 for the last byte of the encoded gap and to 0 otherwise. \n"
