    "# Phrase queries\n",
    "\n",
    "For phrase queries we want to be able to answer eg. \"Stanford University\" as a phrase. It no longer suffices to just store `<term: doc>` entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Biword indexes\n",
    "\n",
    "index every consecutive par of terms in the text.  \n",
    "eg.\n",
    "```\n",
    "friends, Romans, Countrymen\n",
    "is now:\n",
    "friends romans\n",
    "romans countrymen\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We store these bigrams as dictionary terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Longer phrase queries\n",
    "\n",
    "Longer phrase queries such as `stanford univeristy palo alto` are accessed as `stanford university` AND `university palo` AND `palo alto`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extended biwords\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Parse the indexed text and perform POST (parts of speech tagging).\n",
    "2. Bucket the terms into Nouns (N) and articles/ prepostions (X).\n",
    "3. Call any string of terms in the form of `NX*N` an extended biword.\n",
    "\n",
    "eg. `catcher in the rye`  \n",
    "- catcher: N\n",
    "- in: X\n",
    "- the: X\n",
    "- rye: N\n",
    "\n",
    "after **segment query into enhanced biwords**, we have `catcher rye`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "- False positives: Can have false positives as there is no way to ensure that the words appear next to each other.\n",
    "- Index blowup: due to bigger dictionary, infeasible for more than biwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Positional indexes\n",
    "\n",
    "Store positions of the words together within the document ID. eg.\n",
    "```\n",
    "hello\n",
    "{2: 1,4,5}, {10: 5,9,120}, ...\n",
    "\n",
    "world\n",
    "{2: 2,3},...\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then `hello world` is a hit at docID `2` and at position `1, 2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Postional index size\n",
    "- Need an entry for each occurence, not just once per document.\n",
    "- Index size depends on the average document size - depends on how many positions there are in the fist place.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rule of thumb\n",
    "\n",
    "- Positional index size is usually 2-4x larger than a non-positional index\n",
    "- Positional index size is ~35-50% of the volume of original text\n",
    "- Caveat: All of this holds for English-like languages."
